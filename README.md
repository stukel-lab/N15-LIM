# N15 LIM
---

This project integrates N15 values into Linear Inverse Models for ecosystem modeling. Below are the actual scripts:

1. [N15 Setup File](https://github.com/tbrycekelly/N15-LIM/blob/master/InverseN15_Setup%20File.ipynb)
2. [Model Initialization Script](https://github.com/tbrycekelly/N15-LIM/blob/master/RunN15InverseRW.ipynb)
3. [A Modified MCMC Sampling Algorithm](https://github.com/tbrycekelly/N15-LIM/blob/master/xsampleN15.r)
4. [With these additional functions](https://github.com/tbrycekelly/N15-LIM/blob/master/ExternalFunctions.ipynb)

In general, the user accessible scripts are available as with jupyter notebook files or as straight R code.
