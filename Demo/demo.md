# About the Demo

Provided with the source is a complete working set of input and output files. The source code contained within the Notebooks already makes use of the proper input directory to load and run the demo directly. Simply download the entire project and run through the steps below.

1. Run SetMatriciesN15RW to produce the model setup file (e.g. [N15InverseModelRW.DIAZO.Coastal.RW.example.rdata](https://github.com/tbrycekelly/N15-LIM/blob/master/Demo/N15InverseModelRW.example.xlsx)).
2. Run RunN15InverseRW which will load your model input file and then run the model resulting in a model output file (e.g. [N15InverseModel.DIAZO.Coastal.ROutputs.example.rdata](https://github.com/tbrycekelly/N15-LIM/blob/master/Demo/N15InverseModel.DIAZO.Coastal.ROutputs.example.rdata)).


### Input Files

The input files provieded (in Demo/) include the matrix excel file used for all model runs per _Stukel et al._ and the data input file for the Coastal Diazatroph simulation.
